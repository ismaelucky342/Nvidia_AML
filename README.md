# Exploring Adversarial Machine Learning

## Overview

This course by NVIDIA explores the field of **Adversarial Machine Learning (AML)**, a subfield of machine learning focused on understanding and mitigating adversarial threats to AI models. Adversarial Machine Learning involves crafting deceptive inputs to mislead models, potentially leading to incorrect or even dangerous predictions.

The course provides insights into different types of adversarial attacks, methods for evaluating model security, and strategies to defend against these threats. Participants will explore real-world vulnerabilities in AI models and gain hands-on experience with various attack and defense techniques.

## What is Adversarial Machine Learning?

Adversarial Machine Learning studies the security vulnerabilities of AI models, where adversaries can manipulate model inputs to alter predictions. These manipulations, often imperceptible to humans, can significantly impact AI-driven systems, including:

- **Autonomous Vehicles**: Misleading traffic sign recognition systems.
- **Cybersecurity**: Bypassing malware classifiers.
- **Fraud Detection**: Evading anomaly detection models.
- **Healthcare AI**: Altering medical diagnoses by modifying imaging data.

AML involves both offensive (attack) and defensive (protection) strategies to create more robust AI models resistant to adversarial manipulation.

## Course Topics

This course consists of **10+ notebooks across 6 modules**, covering key adversarial machine learning topics:

- **Evasion**: Basics of evading malware classifiers and fooling machine learning models.
- **Extraction**: Techniques for extracting models and their parameters.
- **Assessments**: Framing and tooling for adversarial testing, including optimization strategies.
- **Inversion & Membership Inference**: Extracting sensitive data from models through adversarial means.
- **Poisoning**: Basics of data poisoning attacks and serialization issues.
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Threats like prompt injection, poisoning, and model extraction.

## Learning Outcomes
